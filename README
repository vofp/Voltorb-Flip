Hello This is Francis's Solver,

There are many complaints about Voltorb Flip being too hard. Well complain no more, My program will solve'em all.

There will be a wiki on github, please look there for more help. http://wiki.github.com/firefrancis/Voltorb-Flip/

The only file you need is the voltorbflip.rb and a download version of jruby


These are the color codes for solver
green - finished
orange 5 - safe place please fill them in
blue 6 - only 1 or 0 remain here
yellow 6 - Best place to guess but only 1 or 0, this will help the program to finish
black 6 - Best place to guess with chance of 2 or 3
red 6 - don't guess here no idea what it is yet
Good luck
~ Francis Vo
